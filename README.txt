JORE student record parser
==========================

Installation
------------

This requires Haskell Platform and at least the following package:

- text

This can be fetched on Ubuntu by installing the following package:

- libghc6-text-dev

Compiling can be done with the following command:

$ ghc --make Main.hs

Usage
-----

I suppose you have access to Korppi which is study data system in
University of Jyv채skyl채.

Open Studies ... Transcript of Records. Copy the block which is
typesetted in monospace to a file. The file should start with
"Jyv채skyl채n yliopisto" and the transcript should be in Finnish.

Manual
~~~~~~

You can use the parser manually by running ghci:

$ ghci RecordParser.hs Records.hs
> jore <- parseJoreFromFile "my_records.txt"
> sum $ map credits $ snd jore

If you are lucky enough, you should get number of total credits! If
not, congratulations; you have found a bug.

Cumulative
~~~~~~~~~~

Or you can simply output cumulative student record table:

$ ./Main my_records.txt

To plot them in OpenOffice.org, write the output to files:

$ ./Main my_records.txt >my_records.csv
$ ooffice my_records.csv

Then select comma as separator, locale as English and pick the type of
the first column as Date (YMD). Then it should look nice. Now you can
use your favourite chart. The format is CSV with ISO 8601 dates, so
should be suitable for other programs, eg. Matlab.
